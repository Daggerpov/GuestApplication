# For whoever's taking over this project:

Feel free to email me (via the contact in my GitHub profile) with questions or if anything, such as this GitHub repo, needs to have its ownership transferred.

## Development:

1. Install packages defined in package.json file using `yarn install`
2. Ensure you've received the project's `secrets.ts` file and access to the email used for Firebase configuration.
3. Follow whichever method under using the **React Native CLI** that you'd like in [the documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup), depending on OS of your machine and emulator. I then developed using the `npx react-native run-{android/ios}` command. 

Note that **Expo won't work** alongside the react-native-firebase module

## QOL:

<ul>
    <li>Use the Better Comments Visual Studio Code extension to see marked ones</li>
    <li>Using the Expo development environment will not work with the react-native-firebase module.</li>
</ul>
